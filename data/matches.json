Rafael H scored his second goal in last three matches with an amazing performance. Team controlled the match throughout both halves. First half ended 4-1 with exceptional performances from Adam K, Yejun K, Rafael H, and Ethan G who made many great saves as goalkeeper. Second half saw Travis add the fifth goal with great awareness, following up on an incredible save from their keeper. Opponent scored to make it 5-2, then Travis completed his hat-trick from a Rhodri W corner with a beautiful finish. Final seconds featured an INSANE Buffon-level save from Yejun K. Team showed great depth dealing with absences (Eunjun K fever, Minh-An D travelling) and Niko D's early exit due to muscle injury after just 5 minutes. Perfect way to end the first part of the season! Team celebrated with hot chocolate and photos.",
