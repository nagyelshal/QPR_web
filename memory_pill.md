# Memory Pill - QPR U11B Team Rules & Guidelines

## 🏗️ Formation Rules - UPDATED Sept 2025

### Ultra-Simplified Formation for U11 Rotation
- **2-3-2 Formation**: 2 defenders (CB-CB), 3 midfielders (LM-CM-RM), 2 strikers (ST-ST)
- **Three zones only**: Defence, Midfield, Strikers
- **NO positional specialization** - all players in each zone are interchangeable

### Rotation Philosophy
- **Defence Zone**: Any defender can play either CB position
- **Midfield Zone**: Any midfielder can play LM, CM, or RM positions  
- **Striker Zone**: Any striker can play either ST position
- **Maximum simplicity** for continuous rotation and mixed skill levels

### Historical Formation
- **3-3-1 Formation** preserved for historical matches (e.g., vs CMFSC Millwall)
- Component supports both formations for display purposes

## 👨‍✈️ Captain Rules
- **One captain per half** (not both halves)
- **First Half Captain**: Leads team for first 30 minutes
- **Second Half Captain**: Takes over for second 30 minutes
- Captains handle: warm-ups, set pieces, positioning guidance

## 🥅 Goalkeeper Rules
- **One goalkeeper per half** (not both halves)  
- **First Half GK**: Plays in goal for first 30 minutes
- **Second Half GK**: Plays in goal for second 30 minutes
- When not in goal, the GK plays as field player

## ⏱️ Match Duration
- **30 minutes per half** (total 60 minutes)
- Half-time break between halves
- Captain and GK switch at half-time

## 👕 Kit Rules
- **vs Metro-Ford clubs (CMFSC)**: Home team wears **WHITE**
- **vs Other clubs**: QPR wears **BLUE** (primary kit)
- **White kit**: White shirts, black shorts, white socks
- **Blue kit**: Blue shirts, black shorts, blue socks

## 📋 Lineup Generation Rules - UPDATED Sept 2025
- **Zone-based rotation**: Players rotate within their zone (Defence/Midfield/Strikers)
- **No fixed positions**: Any CB can play either defender slot, any midfielder can play LM/CM/RM
- **Simple substitutions**: Just swap players within the same zone
- Formation maintains 2-3-2 structure but positions are flexible

## 🧠 Coaching Philosophy - Sept 2025 Update
- **U11 with continuous rotation**: Simplicity over tactical complexity
- **Zone-based thinking**: Kids understand "Defence", "Midfield", "Strikers"  
- **No positional confusion**: Eliminates LB/CB/RB specialization during subs
- **Easier mental model**: 2 back, 3 middle, 2 front vs isolated lone striker
- **Rotation-friendly**: Any player can slot into any position within their zone
