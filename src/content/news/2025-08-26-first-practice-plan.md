Great progress on getting our team organized! We're continuing to collect questionnaire responses and distribute kits to all our QPR players.

## Questionnaire Collection Status

We're still gathering questionnaire responses from families to help us understand each player's experience level, preferred positions, and any important information for the coaching team.

### Still Need Responses From
If you haven't submitted your questionnaire yet, please complete it as soon as possible. The information helps us:
- Plan appropriate training activities
- Understand player experience levels
- Know about any medical conditions or allergies
- Learn about player position preferences

**Please submit your responses by Friday, August 30th** so we can be fully prepared for our first practice.

## Kit Distribution Update

Kit distribution is ongoing! We're working hard to get every player their complete QPR uniform package.

### Distribution Progress
- **Completed:** First round of kit distribution
- **In Progress:** Additional kit pickups scheduled
- **Next Phase:** Size replacements and adjustments

### Important Kit Information

**Size Replacements Policy:**  
Kit size replacements will be done after all kits are distributed to ensure we have enough inventory for everyone. If your child's kit doesn't fit perfectly, don't worry - we'll handle all size adjustments once the initial distribution is complete.

### Kit Package Includes
- Home jersey (red)
- Away jersey (white) 
- Shorts (black)
- Socks (red)
- Training shirt

## What's Next

**This Week:**
- Continue questionnaire collection
- Complete remaining kit distributions
- Finalize practice schedule details

**Next Week:**
- Begin size replacement process
- First practice preparation
