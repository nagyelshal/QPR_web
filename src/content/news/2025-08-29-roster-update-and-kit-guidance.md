We have two quick updates for our QPR families.

## Roster Update: Welcome, Eunjun!

We're excited to welcome **Eunjun Kim** to our QPR U11B roster. Jersey number will be confirmed soon. Please help us make Eunjun feel at home!

## Kit Exchanges â€” After Initial Distribution

The Sept 2 pickup window is meant for families who missed the first round of pickups. We won't be processing exchanges at that time. If you need a different size:

- Message the coach with the item and issue
- Include your child's **current sock size** so we can prepare the right replacement
- We'll arrange exchanges once initial distribution is complete

## Goalkeeper Kit Pickup

Goalkeeper kits will be coordinated separately and not at the Sept 2 window. We'll reach out directly with pickup details.

As always, reach out via TeamSnap for any questions.
