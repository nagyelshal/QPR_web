## Wednesday Practice: Crossing Mastery

### October 23, 2025

Yesterday's practice session focused on a crucial skill: **crossing in both attack and defence situations**.

### 🎯 What We Worked On

**Attacking Crosses:**
- Delivery from wide positions
- Timing runs into the box
- Near post vs far post movement
- First-time finishes from crosses

**Defensive Crosses:**
- Positioning to defend crosses
- Communication between defenders
- Clearing techniques
- Goalkeeper positioning and commands

This dual focus helps our team understand crossing from both perspectives, making us more effective in attack and stronger in defence.
