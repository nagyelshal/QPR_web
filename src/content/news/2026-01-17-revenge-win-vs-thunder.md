# Revenge is Sweet! QPR Beat Thunder 3-1 Away

**Final Score: PCFC Thunder 1-3 QPR**

What a performance from the boys! QPR traveled to Gates Turf 1 South and came away with all three points against PCFC Thunder - the same team that beat us earlier in the season. This time, it was a completely different story.

## First Half Dominance

The match started brilliantly for QPR. **Minh-An D** struck early around the 5th minute, finishing a lovely cross from **Rafael H** to give us the lead. From that moment, our team was in complete control.

For the next 20 minutes, PCFC Thunder barely had a sniff of our goal. The midfield was outstanding - **Niko D**, **Rafael H**, **Adam K**, **Ethan G**, and **David C** all put in exceptional shifts, keeping possession and creating chances.

When Thunder did manage to break through, **Henry K** was there to make some crucial saves, keeping our lead intact.

## Second Half Brilliance

The second half saw QPR step up another gear. **Minh-An D** switched from goalscorer to goalkeeper for the second half, and what a job he did! He made several important saves and kept a clean sheet in his half.

The goals came from **Ethan G**, who scored two beautiful goals just minutes apart, both assisted by the brilliant **Rafael H**. Three assists in one match - Rafael was absolutely on fire!

## Fifth Win of the Season!

This victory is our fifth win of the season and comes with extra satisfaction as we avenged our earlier loss to this same team. The boys showed incredible team spirit, determination, and skill.
