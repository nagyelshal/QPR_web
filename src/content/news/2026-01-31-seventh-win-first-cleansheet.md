## Travis C Strikes Again

**Travis C** continued his incredible form with another brace - that's back-to-back two-goal games!

The first goal came in the first half from a beautiful assist by **Owen H**. The second came in the second half, set up brilliantly by **Henry K**.

## Double Clean Sheet

The goalkeeping duo of **Ethan G** (first half) and **Rhodri W** (second half) both made nice saves to keep our first-ever clean sheet. A historic moment for the team!

## Henry's Engine Room Performance

Special mention to **Henry K** who was absolutely everywhere on the field. He maintained our possession brilliantly, assisted the second goal, and covered so much ground throughout the match.

## The Beautiful Counter Attack

The best moment of the match came when **Owen H**, **Minh-An D**, **Travis C**, and **Andy E** combined for an incredible quick-passing counter attack. The ball movement and teamwork on display was breathtaking - showing just how far this team has come in working together.

## Andy's Courageous Return

**Andy E** showed incredible heart today. Despite picking up an injury in the second half, he refused to stay down and went back onto the field. His skills on the ball and teamwork were vital in helping us maintain possession during key moments. A true warrior performance that exemplifies the character of this team.

## Big Performances All Around

**Minh-An D**, **Andy E**, **Travis C**, **Owen H**, and **Henry K** all had outstanding games. The team depth and character on display was remarkable.
